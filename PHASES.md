## Phase 2

Try to use data that have different time scales

## Phase 3

Understanding how the patient has problems (what feature is the problem ?). Ex : two patients have tachycardy, but from different sources.

## Phase 4

What if I give this drug ? -> prediction of FSL on the patient
-> perturbate a node, and see how it diffuses.
